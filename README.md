# Incident-report-analysis

This is a portfolio activity I completed for the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.  
It’s a report about a DDoS attack that happened at a fictional company. I used the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to break down the incident and figure out how to improve the company’s response.

The report covers what happened, what caused it, how it affected the systems, and what steps the team took to fix it. I also wrote out a simple plan on how to protect, detect, respond to, and recover from these kinds of attacks in the future.
